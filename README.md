# Melody_Music_Makers
In my i308 course, my team and I honed our skills in SQL, HTML, and PHP to develop a dynamic website tailored for business needs. 
Our project focused on creating a user-friendly platform for running queries and summarizing vital data. 
Our mock client, an instrument rental and lessons company owner, provided invaluable insights.

This project, which served as our course's final assignment, showcased our ability to merge technical expertise and practical problem-solving.
